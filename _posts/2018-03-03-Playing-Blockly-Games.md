As you may or may not know that the weather in England had been the coldest in 27 years. There have  been lots of snow so we missed half of Thursday and the whole of Friday and yes our IT lesson was on Friday. So we missed it.

  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Mr Keen send me and my classmates and message from Google Classroom and told us to visit a website called Blockly Games and he told us to play 'maze', ‘pond’ and ‘turtle.’</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our target for today was to play the game and reach to level 10 in ‘maze’</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>No, despite my preserving skills, I couldn’t complete level 10, in fact, I didn’t even reach level 6!</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Like I said before, I did try my best, however I failed the task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Since I wasn't in school I couldn’t really question anyone</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I had to be independent even though I didn’t want to.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>This game was a bit like Scratch I had been working on for the last half term.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Again, I did try my best however I couldn’t complete the task.</td>
